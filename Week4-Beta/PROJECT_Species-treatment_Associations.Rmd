## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#reformat data to exclude treatment
slim2 <- Fungi_data %>%
  select(Plot, Species, Relative.Abundance)

# Reshape the data
ExpandFungi_data2 <- slim2 %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Plot, values_from = Relative.Abundance, values_fill = list(Relative.Abundance = 0))

ExpandFungi_data2 <- as.data.frame(ExpandFungi_data2)
rownames(ExpandFungi_data2) <- ExpandFungi_data2$Species
ExpandFungi_data2 <- ExpandFungi_data2[, -1]  # Remove the Species column

# Check the result
dim(ExpandFungi_data2)
head(ExpandFungi_data2)

# Ensure the Treatment variable is a factor
Fungi_data$Treatment <- as.factor(Fungi_data$Treatment)

# Run multipatt with the numeric matrix and Treatment as the cluster variable
indval <- multipatt(ExpandFungi_data2, cluster = Fungi_data$Treatment, func = "IndVal.g", control = how(nperm=999))
summary(indval)

# Standardize data and run multipatt again
fun_rel <- decostand(ExpandFungi_data2, method = "total")
phi <- multipatt(fun_rel, cluster = Fungi_data$Treatment, func = "r.g", control = how(nperm=999))
summary(phi)
```
